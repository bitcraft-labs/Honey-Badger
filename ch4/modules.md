# For Developers

So you want to work on Bitcraft Service Desk? That is wonderful. A little to know about the layout of the code, it is organized in what we call modules. Each piece of the application is in its own folder within ``/modules``.

### What are modules?
**Modules** is a term used to describe the different pieces of this application. The modules in use here are as follows:
- Service Records
- Change Notifications
- Communication / Inbox
- End-User Manager
- End-User Portal

Each of these are the key parts in making the application function as it does. Each module interacts with each of the other ones in order to bring together this seamless application.

Each of these modules will be touched upon in their own chapters.

From the author:<br>
<span style='font-size:10pt;'>*This application is still in extremely alpha. Our folder structure is still extremely discombobulated and hard to read if you weren't coding it with us. It is a lot to take in since everything is kind of everywhere. We tried to keep everything consistently organized but it isn't but will be eventually.*</span>
